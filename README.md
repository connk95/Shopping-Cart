A website for the company ConCept

This website was created for the Odin Project's react course.

This is a website for an imaginary company which can upload memories to the customer's brain

Inspiration for this project came from the need to use stock images for these assignments.
Stock images often feature some kind of scene or memory, which led me to the idea of selling
just that, a memory.

This website features a "memories" page, in place of a product page, with a list of departments,
an "about" page which details the product and service provided by this company,
and a "cart" page which allows users to see their purchase, delete items from their cart, and
checkout (the button to checkout exists, but because this website is not connected to backend,
does not actualy do anything)
